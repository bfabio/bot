# bot

The bot automating the [publiccodeyml organization](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/)

## Commands

The bot is instructed to perform tasks using its tag (fe. @yaml-9000) in issues
and PR comments followed by the command.

* `@yaml-9000 vote-start`: Open the polls for the voting procedure on the current
  proposal

* `@yaml-9000 vote-end`: End the voting procedure, closing the pools and
  announcing the results.

* `@yaml-9000 breaking-change`: Mark the proposal as a [breaking change to the Standard](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/blob/main/governance/procedure-proposing-changes-and-voting.md#proposing-changes).

  Aliases: `breaking`, `major`

* `@yaml-9000 minor-change`: Mark the proposal as a [minor change to the Standard](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/blob/main/governance/procedure-proposing-changes-and-voting.md#proposing-changes)

  Aliases: `minor`

* `@yaml-9000 bugfix-change`: Mark the proposal as a [bugfix change to the Standard](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/blob/main/governance/procedure-proposing-changes-and-voting.md#proposing-changes)

  Aliases: `bugfix`, `patch`

* `@yaml-9000 deprecation-change`: Mark the proposal as a [change deprecating something in the Standard](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/blob/main/governance/procedure-proposing-changes-and-voting.md#proposing-changes)

  It needs the `USERNAME` of the Steering Commitee Member Steering representing that Country as an argument (fe. `@yaml-9000 national-section mickey`).

  Aliases: `national`, `country-section`, `country`, `country-specific`

## Inputs to the GitHub Action

Use the following inputs in the GitHub action via `with`:

* `username` [**Optional**] - GitHub repository to fetch (default `bot`)
* `github_token` [**Optional**] - GitHub token to interact with GitHub API (default `${{ github.token }}`).

  If the environment `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable is set, it takes precedence over
  the input.
